## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project did not introduce anything new from the past two projects, however I definitely solidified my understanding of parent-child relationship in terms of sizing elements, where to use flexbox to manipulate the elements I'm supposed to and where to use margin vs padding.

### Continued development

The next project I choose, I would like it to have JavaScript as a necessary tool so I can used to integrating JS into projects again.
